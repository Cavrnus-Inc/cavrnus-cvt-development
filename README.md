## Project Information  
**Version:** 1.0.0    
**Last Updated:** 2024-09-13

## Introduction

### Overview
The CavrnusCVT plugin offers a seamless way to integrate multi-user collaboration, real-time communication, and Datasmith synchronization into CVT Unreal Engine template projects or even mature, established projects. By simply dragging the Cavrnus plugin into the CVT project, users can effortlessly enhance 3D workflows and embed collaborative features directly into their Unreal projects.

### Project Contents
This repo includes both the CavrnusCVT plugin and the corresponding CavrnusConnector plugin. These must live together in your project's plugin folder in order for proper functionality.

### Requirements
- Unreal Engine 5.x.x

## Getting Started

### Opening Git Project
1. Clone the project using your preferred Git client.
2. Open the project in Unreal Engine 5.x.x.
3. When prompted, opt to build the required modules.
4. Follow the prompts during the build process (note: it is not necessary to generate a project solution).
Once the build completes, the project should open automatically.

## Installing in Other Projects
